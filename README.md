Perl-Programming-Language
Welcome to the Perl Programming Language repository!

Perl is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its flexibility and power. It was originally developed for text processing, but it has since grown into a powerful tool for a wide range of tasks, including system administration, web development, and network programming. Perl is known for its concise syntax and extensive use in bioinformatics, DevOps, and legacy system maintenance.

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to learning Perl, with simple examples, exercises, and explanations to help both beginners and intermediate programmers build a solid foundation in Perl.
